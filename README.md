The platform allows volunteers to register, log in securely, view available time slots, 
and book a slot according to their preference. Meanwhile, the administrator has 
access to an integrated dashboard through which they can monitor bookings, approve 
or reject requests, and manage slot availability in real time. The system is built using 
open-source technologies including Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and MySQL, 
making it both cost-effective and scalable. Key features of the platform include role
based access control, automated email notifications upon booking, real-time slot 
availability updates, and error handling to prevent double bookings. The system also 
maintains a proper record of all users and slot histories for easy tracking and future 
reference. By implementing this system, organizations can eliminate manual 
scheduling conflicts, reduce administrative workload, enhance communication with 
volunteers, and improve the overall efficiency and transparency of event 
management. This project serves as an ideal example of using technology to 
streamline real-world operational problems through a practical and scalable web 
application.
